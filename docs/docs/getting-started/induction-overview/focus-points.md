## Focus Points 

<br>

### Surface Mounted Electronics

A key focus of this induction, is to introduce students to newer electronics assembly processes. 
Namely, [Surface-Mounted Devices][^8] (SMD).

Assembling SMD devices on boards is becoming more common, but is something that is generally too
difficult to do with soldering irons (which is taught for the introductory induction). As surface
mounted packaging is cheaper, more common, and increasingly popular; the Advanced Electronics 
badge fills the gaps for students interested in more modern techniques.

### PCB Schematic and Board Markings

[Printed Circuit Boards][^9] are typically designed so that it is clear for the user, and the
fabrication and assembly services where and how certain components should be used. This includes:

* Identification of components with [Reference Designators][^10]. 
* Package silkscreen [outlines][^11] for alignment and orientation.
* Fabrication markings such as [fiducials][^12] and [names][^13].
* Assembly markings, such as when to leave a component off the board ([DNP][^14]).

### Reflow Curves

The process of pre-heating and oven-induced solder melting, to form connections between the pads
of a PCB, and the pins of a component, is generally referred to as [reflow soldering][^15]. If a PCB
is heated too quickly, or to too high of a temperature, it can [fail][^16]. Alternatively, different
solder alloys, types, and brands, may differ in properties.

This topic is covered in more detail throughout the induction.
