# Component Placement 
<br> 

This part of the exercise is straight forward. The <u>surface mounted</u> components need to 
be placed onto the PCB, above the solderpaste that was printed onto the boards previously in
[Part 1](/docs/exercises/1/). To complete this step correctly, you will need tweezers, and 
attention to detail regarding *what* component you place *in what way*.

::: tip

The order at which you choose to place components may make it easier or harder to place other
components. You can choose a different order of assembly to the one provided in this part, 
but be aware of how accessible certain components are.
