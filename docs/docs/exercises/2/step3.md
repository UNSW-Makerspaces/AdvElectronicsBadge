The final component to place, should be the flash memory. This component is used to store
programs for the microcontroller to run. 

Pay attention to the marking on the black plastic the component is made of. You should have 
the "circle" be in the same orientation as the RP2040 (which also has a circle in one corner). 

The dot on the package, indicates where pin/pad "1" is. Ensure that the orientation of both 
components is correct, or your board will not work!


::: tip 


The index pin position, including other useful information, can be found with the 
interactive BOM tool mentioned [earlier][3].
