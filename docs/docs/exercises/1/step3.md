## Common Mistakes 

If solderpaste is applied incorrectly, your reflow attempt may fail or be difficult to complete. 
Generally, you must ensure that: 

::: details The solderpaste is in the correct location



Determining if this is the case should be easy, as all of the pads intended for reflow, clearly
should have paste covering them, and the paste should not "spill" over them or be offset.

::: details Solderpaste is "overprinted"

When too much solderpaste is applied (not enough pressure used) during the stencil "print",
the effect is "overprinted". Or, **the solderpaste has been applied too heavily**.

See below, for a good comparison of "overprinted" and "adequately printed".
