## Prepare PCB, Components

The first step is to collect the PCB, and the components that need to be soldered to the PCB. 
A tray is provided, (below) that contains all of the necessary surface mounted components that 
are used within this induction, as well as a pair of tweezers.

In groups of **5 people**, a simply "stencil holder" jig, along with a stencil is additionally
provided for parts 1-3 of this induction.

It is recommended that you make sure you have all the components that you need before starting 
[part 3](/docs/exercises/3/). A graphical bill-of-materials (BOM) and preview of the PCB, can be found in
[resources](/docs/more/htmlbom/).

Looking for in-depth information about how stencils work? A write-up can be found
[here](/docs/more/equipment/#stencils).
